/**
 * Shapes With N Sides
 * Create a function that takes a whole number as input and returns the shape with that number's amount of sides. Here are the expected outputs to get from these inputs.
 * 
 * Inputs	Outputs
 * 1	"circle"
 * 2	"semi-circle"
 * 3	"triangle"
 * 4	"square"
 * 5	"pentagon"
 * 6	"hexagon"
 * 7	"heptagon"
 * 8	"octagon"
 * 9	"nonagon"
 * 10	"decagon"
 * Examples
 * nSidedShape(3) ➞ "triangle"
 * 
 * nSidedShape(1) ➞ "circle"
 * 
 * nSidedShape(9) ➞ "nonagon"
 * Notes
 * There won't be any tests with a number below 1 or greater than 10.
 * Return the output in lowercase.
 * The challenge is intended to be completed without conditionals (it would take too long)!
 * 
 * Test.assertEquals(nSidedShape(1), "circle")
 * Test.assertEquals(nSidedShape(2), "semi-circle")
 * Test.assertEquals(nSidedShape(3), "triangle")
 * Test.assertEquals(nSidedShape(4), "square")
 * Test.assertEquals(nSidedShape(5), "pentagon")
 * Test.assertEquals(nSidedShape(6), "hexagon")
 * Test.assertEquals(nSidedShape(7), "heptagon")
 * Test.assertEquals(nSidedShape(8), "octagon")
 * Test.assertEquals(nSidedShape(9), "nonagon")
 * Test.assertEquals(nSidedShape(10), "decagon")
